## Overview of the project
The idea of the project is to simulate the Wipe Out experience from the comfort of your chair at home. Wipe Out is an obstacle course, where the goal is to navigate the course and get to the end platform without falling down, or getting pushed of by any of the obstacles. The player controls a capsule in 1st person, and can look and move around using the mouse and keyboard.   
The main parts of the game are:  
* Player - a capsule with a camera attached, can be rotaded with the mouse and moved with WASD or the arrow keys. You are also able to tilt the camera up and down with the mouse to lookabove and belov you.
* The Course - a series of platforms the player can jump to
* The Rotating obstacle - a rotating propella made by 3 capsules and a cylinder 
* The Sideswipping obstacle - a big cube moving from side to side
* The Bouncing Ball - a sphere with a bouncy physics material
* The Endzone - the platform the player needs to get to
